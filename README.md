# The Nova Vulgata Macronization Project

All books have been automatically macronized using Alatius' [Latin Macronizer](https://alatius.com/macronizer/).

Once the book is macronized, it's necessary for a human to edit the vowel lengths by hand to clarify any ambiguous cases and/or correct any errors that were made by the machine.

Some words and names, especially Latinized versions of Greek or Hebrew names have ambiguous or indeterminite vowel length. These cases are being noted in the [Ambiguous Forms](<./nova-vulgata/Ambiguous Forms.md>) document and linked in the text where appropriate.

If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to submit a pull request or file an issue with any corrections!
